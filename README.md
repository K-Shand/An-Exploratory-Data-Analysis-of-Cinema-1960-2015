# An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Cinema-1960-2015-

In this report, I will be completing an exploratory data analysis on films collected within The Movie Database (TMDb) from 1960-2015.
The report uncovers various trends, focusing particularly on the below points:

  Which parties are the most active and the most profitable in the film industry?
  What qualities create a high revenue generating film?

I will be using statistics and visualisations to move through the 10,000 strong movie database in Python and answer the stated questions.

I hope you enjoy the report!

Utilises: Various packages in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
